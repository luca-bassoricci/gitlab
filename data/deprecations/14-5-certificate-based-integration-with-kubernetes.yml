    [The certificate-based integration with Kubernetes will be deprecated and removed](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/).

    As a self-managed customer, we are introducing a feature flag in GitLab 15.0, so you can keep
    certificate-based integration enabled. The flag will be disabled by default. This means this is a **breaking change**.
    We plan to follow-up and remove the flag and the related code completely in GitLab 15.6.

    Until the final removal in 15.6, features built on the integration will continue to work, if the feature flag is enabled. 
    GitLab will continue to fix security and critical issues as they arise.

    For a more robust, secure, forthcoming, and reliable integration with Kubernetes, we recommend you use the
    [agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab.
    See the documentation for [how to migrate](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/migrate_to_gitlab_agent.html).
