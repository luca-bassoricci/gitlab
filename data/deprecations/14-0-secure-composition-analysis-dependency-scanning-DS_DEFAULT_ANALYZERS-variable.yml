    To exclude a DS analyzer previously you needed to remove it from the default list of analyzers and use that to set the `DS_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS` variable in your projectâ€™s CI template. We determined it should be easier to avoid running a particular analyzer without losing the benefit of newly added analyzers. Now you should be able to migrate from `DS_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS` to `DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` as [described in the documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/analyzers.html#disable-specific-analyzers).
