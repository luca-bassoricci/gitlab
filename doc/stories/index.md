# Stories at GitLab

Welcome to the stroies.
This documentaion show-cases how a person accomplishes their mission within GitLab.
Each story begins with a clear definition of personas, job role and its resposibilities.
And, it describes how the person actually accomplish their tasks with GitLab features.

Unlike the other feature centric documentation, stories exclusively focus on user jorney,
so various features could be used across different DevOps stages.
This is also used for measuring usability factors from [macro perspective](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/product-design/#macro-ux).

Here are the stories:
