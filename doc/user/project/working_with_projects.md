# Working with projects **(FREE)**

Most work in GitLab is done in a [project](../../user/project/index.md). Files and
code are saved in projects, and most features are in the scope of projects.

## View projects

To explore projects:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Project**.
1. Select **Explore projects**.

GitLab displays a list of projects, sorted by last updated date. 

- To view projects with the most [stars](#star-a-project), select **Most stars**. 
- To view projects with the largest number of comments in the past month, select **Trending**.

NOTE:
By default, the **Explore projects** tab is visible to unauthenticated users. If the
[**Public** visibility level](../admin_area/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.md#restrict-visibility-levels)
is restricted, the **Explore projects** tab is visible only to signed-in users.

## Create a project

To create a project in GitLab:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Project**. 
1. Select **Create new project**.
1. On the **New project** page, choose if you want to:
   - Create a [blank project](#create-a-blank-project).
   - Create a project from a:
      - [built-in template](#create-a-project-from-a-built-in-template). 
      - [custom template](#create-a-project-from-a-custom-template).  
      - [HIPAA audit protocol template](#create-a-project-from-the-hipaa-audit-protocol-template).
   - If enabled in your GitLab instance, [import a project](../../user/project/import/index.md) 
   from a different repository. Contact your GitLab administrator if this is unavailable.
   - [Connect an external repository to GitLab CI/CD](../../ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/index.md).

NOTE:
For a list of words that can't be used as project names see
[reserved project and group names](../../user/reserved_names.md).

## Create a blank project

To create a blank project:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Project**. 
1. Select **Create new project**.
1. Select **Create blank project**.
1. Enter the project details:
   - In the **Project name** field, enter the name of your project. You can use spaces, hyphens, 
     underscores, and emoji. You cannot use special characters. After you enter the name, 
     the **Project slug** populates.
   - In the **Project slug** field, enter the path to your project. The GitLab instance uses the 
     slug as the URL path to the project. To change the slug, first enter the project name, 
     then change the slug.

     can be cloned, select **Initialize repository with a README**.
   - To analyze the source code in the project for known security vulnerabilities, 
   select **Enable Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**.   
1. Select **Create project**.

## Create a project from a built-in template

A built-in project template populates a new project with files to get you started.
Built-in templates are sourced from the following groups:

- [`project-templates`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates)
- [`pages`](https://gitlab.com/pages)

Anyone can contribute a built-in template by following [these steps](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/project-templates/).

## Push to create a new project

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/26388) in GitLab 10.5.

Use `git push` to push a local project repository to GitLab. After you push a repository, 
GitLab creates your project in your chosen namespace.

You cannot use `git push` to create projects with project paths that:

- Have previously been used.
- [Renamed](settings/index.md#renaming-a-repository). 

Previously used project paths have a redirect. The redirect causes push attempts to redirect requests 
to the renamed project location, instead of creating a new project. To create a new project for a previously 
used or renamed project, use the [UI](#create-a-project) or the [Projects API](../../api/projects.md#create-project).

Pre-requisites:

- To push with SSH, you must have [an SSH key](../../ssh/index.md) that is
[added to your GitLab account](../../ssh/index.md#add-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account).
- You must have permission to add new projects to a namespace. To check if you have permission:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Project**.
1. Select **Groups**.
1. Select a group.
1. Confirm that **New project** is visible in the upper right corner. Contact your GitLab 
administrator if you require permission.

To push your repository and create a project:

1. Push with SSH or HTTPS:
   - To push with SSH: 

      ```shell
      git push --set-upstream git@gitlab.example.com:namespace/myproject.git master
      ```

   - To push with HTTPS: 

      ```shell
      git push --set-upstream https://gitlab.example.com/namespace/myproject.git master
      ```

   - For `gitlab.example.com`, use the domain name of the machine that hosts your Git repository.
   - For `namespace`, use the name of your [namespace](../group/index.md#namespaces).
   - For `myproject`, use the name of your project.
   - Optional. To export existing repository tags, append the `--tags` flag to your `git push` command.
1. Optional. To configure the remote:
   
   ```shell
   git remote add origin https://gitlab.example.com/namespace/myproject.git
   ```

When the push completes, GitLab displays the message:

   ```shell
   remote: The private project namespace/myproject was created.
   ```

To view your new project, go to `https://gitlab.example.com/namespace/myproject`.
Your project's visibility is set to **Private** by default. To change project visibility, adjust your 
[project's settings](../../public_access/public_access.md#change-project-visibility).

## Import a project

If enabled on your GitLab instance, you can [migrate a project](../../user/project/import/index.md) to your GitLab instance. Contact your GitLab administrator if this is not enabled.

## Connect an external repository to GitLab CI/CD **(PREMIUM)**

Instead of moving your entire project to GitLab, you can 
[connect your external repository](../../ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/index.md) to get the benefits of GitLab CI/CD.

## Fork a project

A fork is a copy of an original repository that you put in another namespace.
You can [fork a project](repository/forking_workflow.md#creating-a-fork) to experiment and apply 
changes, without affecting the original project.

## Star a project

You can add a star to projects you use frequently to make them easier to find.

To add a star to a project:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Project**.
1. Select **Your projects** or **Explore projects**.
1. Select a project.
1. In the upper right corner of the page, select **Star**.

## View starred projects

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Project**.
1. Select **Starred projects**.
1. GitLab displays information about your starred projects, including:

   - Project description, including name, description, and icon.
   - Number of times this project has been starred.
   - Number of times this project has been forked.
   - Number of open merge requests.
   - Number of open issues.

## Delete a project

After you delete a project, projects in personal namespaces are deleted immediately. You can 
[enable delayed project removal](../group/index.md#enable-delayed-project-removal) to 
delay deletion of projects in a group.

To delete a project:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Project**.
1. Select **Your projects** or **Explore projects**.
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand the **Advanced** section.
1. Scroll down to the **Delete project** section.
1. Select **Delete project**
1. Confirm this action by completing the field.

## Adjust project visibility and access levels 

Adjust the project settings to set the [project's visibility and access levels](settings/index.md#sharing-and-permissions).

## View project activity

To view the activity of a project:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Project**.
1. Select **Your projects** or **Explore projects**.
1. Select a project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Project information > Activity**.
1. Select a tab to view the type of project activity.

## Leave a project

If you leave a project you are no longer a project
member and cannot contribute.

To leave a project:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Project**.
1. Select **Your projects** or **Explore projects**.
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Leave project**. The **Leave project** option only displays 
on the project dashboard when a project is part of a group under a 
[group namespace](../group/index.md#namespaces).

## Use your project as a Go package

Any project can be used as a Go package. GitLab responds correctly to `go get`
and `godoc.org` discovery requests, including the
[`go-import`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Remote_import_paths) and
[`go-source`](https://github.com/golang/gddo/wiki/Source-Code-Links) meta tags.

Private projects, including projects in subgroups, can be used as a Go package.
These projects may require configuration to work correctly. GitLab responds correctly
to `go get` discovery requests for projects that *are not* in subgroups,
regardless of authentication or authorization.
[Authentication](#authenticate-go-requests) is required to use a private project
in a subgroup as a Go package. Otherwise, GitLab truncates the path for
private projects in subgroups to the first two segments, causing `go get` to
fail.

GitLab implements its own Go proxy. This feature must be enabled by an
administrator and requires additional configuration. See [GitLab Go
Proxy](../packages/go_proxy/index.md).

### Disable Go module features for private projects

In Go 1.12 and later, Go queries module proxies and checksum databases in the
process of [fetching a
module](../../development/go_guide/dependencies.md#fetching). This can be
selectively disabled with `GOPRIVATE` (disable both),
[`GONOPROXY`](../../development/go_guide/dependencies.md#proxies) (disable proxy
queries), and [`GONOSUMDB`](../../development/go_guide/dependencies.md#fetching)
(disable checksum queries).

`GOPRIVATE`, `GONOPROXY`, and `GONOSUMDB` are comma-separated lists of Go
modules and Go module prefixes. For example,
`GOPRIVATE=gitlab.example.com/my/private/project` disables queries for that
one project, but `GOPRIVATE=gitlab.example.com` disables queries for *all*
projects on GitLab.com. Go does not query module proxies if the module name or a
prefix of it appears in `GOPRIVATE` or `GONOPROXY`. Go does not query checksum
databases if the module name or a prefix of it appears in `GONOPRIVATE` or
`GONOSUMDB`.

### Authenticate Go requests

To authenticate requests to private projects made by Go, use a [`.netrc`
file](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/netrc) and a [personal access
token](../profile/personal_access_tokens.md) in the password field. **This only
works if your GitLab instance can be accessed with HTTPS.** The `go` command
does not transmit credentials over insecure connections. This authenticates
all HTTPS requests made directly by Go, but does not authenticate requests made
through Git.

For example:

```plaintext
machine gitlab.example.com
login <gitlab_user_name>
password <personal_access_token>
```

NOTE:
On Windows, Go reads `~/_netrc` instead of `~/.netrc`.

### Authenticate Git fetches

If a module cannot be fetched from a proxy, Go falls back to using Git (for
GitLab projects). Git uses `.netrc` to authenticate requests. You can also
configure Git to either:

- Embed specific credentials in the request URL.
- Use SSH instead of HTTPS, as Go always uses HTTPS to fetch Git repositories.

```shell
# Embed credentials in any request to GitLab.com:
git config --global url."https://${user}:${personal_access_token}@gitlab.example.com".insteadOf "https://gitlab.example.com"

# Use SSH instead of HTTPS:
git config --global url."git@gitlab.example.com".insteadOf "https://gitlab.example.com"
```

### Fetch Go modules from Geo secondary sites

As Go modules are stored in Git repositories, you can use the [Geo](../../administration/geo/index.md)
feature that allows Git repositories to be accessed on the secondary Geo servers.

In the following examples, the primary's site domain name is `gitlab.example.com`,
and the secondary's is `gitlab-secondary.example.com`.

`go get` will initially generate some HTTP traffic to the primary, but when the module
download commences, the `insteadOf` configuration sends the traffic to the secondary.

#### Use SSH to access the Geo secondary

To fetch Go modules from the secondary using SSH:

1. Reconfigure Git on the client to send traffic for the primary to the secondary:

   ```plaintext
   git config --global url."git@gitlab-secondary.example.com".insteadOf "https://gitlab.example.com"
   git config --global url."git@gitlab-secondary.example.com".insteadOf "http://gitlab.example.com"
   ```

1. Ensure the client is set up for SSH access to GitLab repositories. This can be tested on the primary,
   and GitLab will replicate the public key to the secondary.

#### Use HTTP to access the Geo secondary

Using HTTP to fetch Go modules does not work with CI/CD job tokens, only with
persistent access tokens that are replicated to the secondary.

To fetch Go modules from the secondary using HTTP:

1. Put in place a Git `insteadOf` redirect on the client:

   ```plaintext
   git config --global url."https://gitlab-secondary.example.com".insteadOf "https://gitlab.example.com"
   ```

1. Generate a [personal access token](../profile/personal_access_tokens.md) and
   provide those credentials in the client's `~/.netrc` file:

   ```plaintext
   machine gitlab.example.com login USERNAME password TOKEN
   machine gitlab-secondary.example.com login USERNAME password TOKEN
   ```

## Access project page with project ID

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/53671) in GitLab 11.8.

To quickly access a project from the GitLab UI using the project ID,
visit the `/projects/:id` URL in your browser or other tool accessing the project.

## Project's landing page

The project's landing page shows different information depending on
the project's visibility settings and user permissions.

For public projects, and to members of internal and private projects
with [permissions to view the project's code](../permissions.md#project-members-permissions):

- The content of a
  [`README` or an index file](repository/index.md#readme-and-index-files)
  is displayed (if any), followed by the list of directories in the
  project's repository.
- If the project doesn't contain either of these files, the
  visitor sees the list of files and directories of the repository.

For users without permissions to view the project's code, GitLab displays:

- The wiki homepage, if any.
- The list of issues in the project.
